# FoalTS React App Example

Aims to be a starting point for a real application using FoalTS and React.

## Getting Started

Run `yarn install` to install Git hooks and install dependencies for the client and server.

### Using Yarn 2

If you're using Yarn 2 you will need to install the Git hooks with this command: `yarn husky install`

## Debugging

This includes a set of tasks and debug configurations to immediately get you going with full front and backend
debugging. To get started:

1. Open the command palette and run `Tasks: Run Task`
2. Select the `npm: develop` task to start the server
3. Repeat process and run `npm: watch` to start the client
4. Go to the debugging tab and run `Debug`
6. You are now debugging the server and the client at the same time!

## Additional Technologies

Check out other branches on here, such as `redux`, to get a version equipped to use that technology.
